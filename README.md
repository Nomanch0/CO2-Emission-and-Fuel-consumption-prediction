# CO2-Emission-and-Fuel-consumption-prediction
Designed a Hybrid model for Dual prediction of COâ‚‚ and fuel consumption using DL (Feature Transformer) and ML (XGBoost). Built a Meta Classifier combining outputs from both models, with XGBoost as the final decision layer. Applied feature scaling, transformation, and trained using TensorFlow and scikit-learn.
